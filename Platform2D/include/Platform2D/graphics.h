	@section intro INTRODUCTION

	Platform2D is an engine with the idea of abstracting  a lot of the nuances
	that come with implementing a 2D platform game. It handles a lot of the
	behind-the-scenes work so the developer can focus solely on the game. It is
	designed to be fast and flexible. It utilizes SFML libraries for both
	graphics and sound and is written in native C++ code.
